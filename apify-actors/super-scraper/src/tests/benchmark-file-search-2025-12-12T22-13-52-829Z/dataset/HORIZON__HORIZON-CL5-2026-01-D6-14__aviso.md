## Descrição

Expected Outcome:Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:Knowledge of high-risk locations along the road network becoming available, before crashes actually occur, enabling road authorities to deploy appropriate countermeasures proactively;Predictive identification of safety-critical situations based on data from multiple sources and enabling real-time interventions to avoid crashes;Determination of the optimal sample size to allow for reliable real-time
