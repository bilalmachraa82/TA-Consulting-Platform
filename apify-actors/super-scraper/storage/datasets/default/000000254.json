	"descricao": "Expected Outcome:Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are one of the cheapest and fastest growing sources of electricity generation, largely thanks to an important decrease in the cost of solar modules in the last 10-15 years and to their simple installation. There is no PV lifetime definition, but manufacturers usually guarantee a 25-year lifetime with an expected degradation rate of 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, a surge in the number of end-of-life (EOL) PV modules is expected, of which crystalline si",
